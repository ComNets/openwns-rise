# Converts an output file with antenna radiation patterns created in simulations
# with rise (usually Antennas.dat), and given as the first parameter, to
# postscript (Antennas.dat.ps).
#
# The postscript file is created in the same location as the .dat
# Script can be called from any location; provide a path to the .dat file.
