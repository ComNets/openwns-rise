		 * Omni directional antenna pattern has the same gain in all azimuth
		 * angles. Over elevation angle it changes, though: the highest gain is
		 * in the horizontal plane, and the lowest in vertical. Omni directional
		 * antenna has a gain of ~5dB for elevation angle 90ï¿½.
		 * This is in contrast to isotropic antenna which has the gain of zero
		 * in all the directions.
